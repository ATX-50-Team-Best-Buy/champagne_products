      answer: `A: The PS4 Slim outputs games at full 1080p, while the PS4 Pro can output games at up to 4K resolution (2160p). If you have a 4K television, you'll see a noticeable difference in game quality. Note that not all games support 4K, but some will receive updates such as higher framerates, making gameplay smoother.`,

    description: `Introducing Nintendo Switch, the new home video game system from Nintendo. In addition to providing single and multiplayer thrills at home, the Nintendo Switch system can be taken on the go so players can enjoy a full home console experience anytime, anywhere. The mobility of a handheld is now added to the power of a home gaming system, with unprecedented new play styles brought to life by the two new Joy-Con controllers.
    PLAY ANYWHERE
    At home the system rests in the Nintendo Switch dock, which lets you play with family and friends on a TV in the comfort of your living room.
    By simply lifting Nintendo Switch from the dock at any time, the system instantly transitions to handheld mode, and the same great gaming experience that was being enjoyed at home now travels with you. The portability of Nintendo Switch is enhanced by its 6.2-inch screen, which displays bright, high-definition gameplay at the park, on an airplane, in a car, or at a friend's apartment.
    Nintendo Switch comes with two Joy-Con that can each act as a standalone controller with an analog stick, a full complement of face and shoulder buttons, built in motion-sensing technology and new HD Rumble. They can be inserted into a Joy-Con grip accessory to be used like a traditional controller, held comfortably in each hand for independent left and right motion controls, or shared between two players for instant multiplayer gaming in front of the TV or out on the go.
    This bundle includes the Nintendo Switch console and Nintendo Switch dock in black, with contrasting left and right Joy-Con controllers-one blue, one red. It also includes all the extras you need to get started.
    If you don’t already have a Nintendo Switch Online membership, you can try it out with a free 7-day trial. Don't worry if you already activated a previous free trial— an additional seven-day free trial is now available.
    Nintendo Switch Online membership and Nintendo Account required for online features. Free trial automatically converts to 1-month auto-renewing membership unless automatic renewal is turned off by the end of the free trial. Credit card/PayPal account required for 18+. Free trial cannot be redeemed by a Nintendo Account with an active Individual Membership or Family Membership. Not available in all countries. Internet access required for online features.

    Luigi’s invited to the towering Last Resort hotel, but when Mario and friends go missing, our green-clad hero will have to conquer his fears to save them! Slam, blow away, and vacuum up ghosts with the all-new Poltergust G-00, and join forces with Gooigi to overcome the puzzling contraptions and mischievous boss on each themed floor. And that’s just the Last Resort. Enter the ScareScraper for 8-player local wireless or online co-op gameplay.
    See if you can defeat all the ghosts, rescue all the toads, or clear other objectives before time runs out…in the ScareScraper! And for more mini-game madness, compete on teams at the ScreamPark! Whether you play with friends or wander the hotel alone, you’ll be sucked in by the atmospheric music and ghoulish décor of every cobwebby corner you explore. Why not take in the cinematic sights and sounds with a friend? In the main adventure, you and a friend can play together as Luigi and Gooigi in two-player co-op! Gooigi can walk on spikes, slip through tight spaces, and help Luigi overcome obstacles he can’t tackle alone. Never hurts to have a friend in this hotel; it may not be very spooky, but Luigi begs to differ!`,

On the flip side, stages can be played backwards, providing new perspectives to explore and new ways to locate some of the more craftily hidden items!
    It all started when Kamek and Baby Bowser set out to steal a gem-set stone. Legend has it that this fabled artifact can grant the bearer their wildest dreams! But when the artifact’s gems are sent flying, it falls upon Yoshi and friends to find them. Luckily, saving the day can be cooperative and challenging. Pass a Joy-Con™ controller to a friend to team up as fellow Yoshis. Also, Mellow mode gives Yoshi wings for a breezier experience, which may come in handy! Finding all the flowers, coins, and Poochy Pups is no small feat! For extra protection, suit up in one of the handicraft costumes you can unlock in-game!`,

        "I'm considering buying a 65\" Q800T 8k TV soon. My Question is, my cable provider is Directv TV. They only transmit 4K signal. Is it worth buying an 8K TV using a 4K signal? Is the resolution going to be noticeable or am I better off buying a 4K TV?",
      answer:
        " RCF01, the Q800T features our Quantum Processor 8K, which allows for 8K AI Upscaling. Whatever content you are watching, the Quantum Processor will know exactly what to do and automatically adapt to give you the very best sound and picture that fits into any environment.
